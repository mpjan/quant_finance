# quant_finance

This repo is a collection of personal experiments as I learn about data science and quantitative finance.

So far, theese experiments include:

- [An exploratory data analysis of bitcoin prices](https://github.com/mpjan/quant_finance/blob/master/btc_prices_eda/BTC%20prices%20EDA.ipynb)
- [Trading bitcoin with Google Trends]()

GitHub frequently fails to render notebooks. If that happens, you can go to <https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/> and simply paste the GitHub link to the notebook there.
