# quant_finance

This repo is a collection of personal experiments as I learn more about data science and quantitative finance.

## Index

So far, these experiments include:

- [An exploratory data analysis of bitcoin prices](https://github.com/mpjan/quant_finance/blob/master/btc_prices_eda/BTC%20prices%20EDA.ipynb)
- [Trading bitcoin with Google Trends](https://github.com/mpjan/quant_finance/blob/master/trading_crypto_with_google_trends/trading_btc_with_google_trends.ipynb)

## GitHub and rendered Jupyter notebooks

If GitHub fails to render a notebook, you can go to <https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/> and simply paste the GitHub link to the notebook there.
